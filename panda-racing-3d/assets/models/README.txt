IMPORTANT: PLACE YOUR 3D MODELS HERE

1. Panda Avatar: Rename your panda model file to 'panda.glb' and place it in this folder.
2. Car Model: Rename your car model file to 'car.glb' and place it in this folder.

Supported formats: .glb, .gltf
The game will automatically try to load:
- assets/models/panda.glb
- assets/models/car.glb

If you have multiple cars or avatars, name them:
- car_01.glb, car_02.glb
- panda_01.glb, panda_02.glb
