# Panda Racing 3D

## How to Run

Since this game uses modern 3D web technologies, it requires a local server to run (to load 3D models and scripts securely).

1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell).
2. Navigate to this directory:
   ```sh
   cd C:\Users\namra\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\pandagaming\panda-racing-3d
   ```
3. Run the following command (Python is installed):
   ```sh
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to:
   [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## How to Add Your Models

1. Go to the `assets/models` folder.
2. Paste your Panda model and rename it to `panda.glb`.
3. Paste your Car model and rename it to `car.glb`.
