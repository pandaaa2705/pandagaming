## Setup Instructions

### Initial Setup (Already Done)

1. ✅ Git repository initialized
2. ✅ Remote connected to: https://github.com/pandaaa2705/pandagaming
3. ✅ All files committed

### Auto-Push Configuration

**Option 1: Git Hooks (Recommended for Local Development)**

The post-commit hook is configured to automatically push commits to GitHub. This works on Windows with Git Bash.

**Option 2: Manual Push**

```bash
git push origin main
```

**Option 3: GitHub Actions**

Updates to the `main` branch automatically trigger workflows.

## Making Updates

1. Make changes to your files
2. Stage changes: `git add .`
3. Commit: `git commit -m "Your message"`
4. Automatic push will occur (if hooks are enabled)

Or manually push: `git push origin main`

## Authentication

If prompted for authentication, use:
- **Username**: Your GitHub username
- **Password/Token**: A Personal Access Token (PAT) from GitHub settings
  - Go to Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
  - Create a token with `repo` scope
  - Use this token as your password when prompted

## Future Development

When adding new features:
1. Create changes locally
2. Commit with descriptive messages
3. Push to GitHub (automatic or manual)
4. Track progress in GitHub Issues/Projects
